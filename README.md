this repository contains 3 main files:

The first contains Codes to write in Arduino environment for the projects to function before uploding to the microprocessor in use, 
here ESP32 or ESP8266 are recommended for their capacity to connect to Wifi.
Also in use of this code, modify the credentials of Wifi connection.

The second contains the main libraries you need to install for the codes to work and to link the microprocessor
and the BLYNK app either MOBILE or WEB. Again, make sure you modify the Blynk credentials before uploading.
